About me
====
I am currently a postdoc at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). Previously, I received my Ph.D. from HUST in 2024 (advisor: Prof. [Ruixuan Li](http://idc.hust.edu.cn/rxli/index.html)) and my B.S. from HUST in 2019.

Research
====
- **Theory:** Causality, information theory.
- **Applications:** Interpretability, natural language processing

- My recent research has been concentrating on various issues related to large language models and causality. I am looking for collaboration partners, and interested individuals are welcome to contact me.
